 *   <li><b>Manhattan Distance:</b> Prioritizes direct movement along axes.
 *   <li><b>Octile Distance:</b> Allows for diagonal movement for finer-grained pathing.
 *   <li><b>Perpendicular Distance:</b> Penalizes deviation from the straight line to the target,
 *       aiding in smoother paths.
 *   <li><b>Height Difference:</b> Factors in elevation changes when calculating path costs.
